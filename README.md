In this project, I leveraged pandas for data manipulation and analysis and Matplotlib for visualizing trends within the cryptocurrency market. The focus was on exploring key metrics like market capitalization, price volatility, and identifying top-performing and underperforming cryptocurrencies over specific time periods. I used various techniques to filter, aggregate, and plot data, providing insights into market trends, price movements, and overall market behavior. The project culminated in the creation of informative visualizations such as bar charts and subplots to display the top winners and losers in the market.
